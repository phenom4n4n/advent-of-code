My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

# Configuration
Create a `.env` file and store your [session cookie](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1) under the AOC_SESSION variable to automatically fetch and download input.
```
AOC_SESSION=<session_cookie>
```
This repo requires its root to be added to Python's path in order to run correctly. Opening it as a workspace in VSCode will use the `.vscode/settings.json` to properly configure this. PyCharm users must enable "Add content roots to PYTHONPATH".

# Requirements
You can install the requirements for these solutions with:
```
pip(3) install -Ur requirements.txt
```
